He is far more intimidating if placed against parties with a much lower level than his challenge, which is important to consider, because Roldin always fights alone. </p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>There's a great deal of mystery in Roldin's backstory, which the players will have to learn to before defeating him once and for all. How did Roldin really get trapped in the Plane of Shadow, how did he survive, and how did he return? Is Roldin acting alone, or at the behest of a more powerful entity? The only people that know the answers to these questions were the knights of Roldin's past, now old men, and being picked off one at a time by the vengeful knight.</p><p>Roldin can also be adapted to campaigns which focus on other planes, rather than the Plane of Shadow. A portal to the Abyss, the Hells, or the Far Realm can provide a suitable alternate origin for Roldin as well.</p><p><b>Origin</b></p><p>Roldin was a young knight when the Long Night began. The sun simply never rose, and the land fell into chaos, as sinister creatures from under the earth arose to terrorize the surface. A mighty band of knights were summoned to restore order and daylight to the land. Roldin was counted among their number, as was his mentor, Kester the Brave. </p><p>Eventually, the band of knights found the source of the darkness, a decrepit mage's tower, swarming with living shadows. Somehow, the tower's resident had haphazardly opened a portal to the Plane of Shadow, which spiraled out of control, consumed the top floor of the tower, and caused an endless night.</p><p>The knights battled their way to the source of the disaster, slaying shadows as they went, but when they at last arrived, only Roldin and Kester still stood. As Kester tells it, both fought valiantly, but the void closed around Roldin, trapping him within. The other knights were revived, and given a hero's welcome upon returning home, but Roldin was never seen again. At least, that is, until a few weeks ago. </p><p>A knight in jet-black armor wielding Roldin's sword appeared out of thin air in the king's palace, slew Kester the Brave, and vanished just as quickly. Perhaps, the Black Knight only seeks revenge against the knights that once led him to the ill-fated tower, or perhaps he seeks to bring the Long Night again.</p><p><b>Battling Roldin</b></p><p>Roldin makes liberal use of his ability to become invisible at will, and prefers to strike unseen, and vanish quickly when his foe is slain. Only with a great deal of luck, and the ability to detect illusion magic, will the party ever catch him off-guard or interrupt one of his assassinations. </p><p>If he perceives the party to be a threat to his larger goals, or if the party successful impedes him, Roldin will strike them when they are at their most vulnerable: directly following a difficult fight with another foe, at the exact middle of a precarious rope bridge, or at night, when the campfire has just been extinguished. </p><p>Roldin is persistent, and does not sleep, eat, or drink. He will stalk his target for an extended time before striking, and is a devastating force when he appears.</p></div>","public":""},"alignment":"lawful

He is far more intimidating if placed against parties with a much lower level than his challenge, which is important to consider, because Roldin always fights alone. </p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>There's a great deal of mystery in Roldin's backstory, which the players will have to learn to before defeating him once and for all. How did Roldin really get trapped in the Plane of Shadow, how did he survive, and how did he return? Is Roldin acting alone, or at the behest of a more powerful entity? The only people that know the answers to these questions were the knights of Roldin's past, now old men, and being picked off one at a time by the vengeful knight.</p><p>Roldin can also be adapted to campaigns which focus on other planes, rather than the Plane of Shadow. A portal to the Abyss, the Hells, or the Far Realm can provide a suitable alternate origin for Roldin as well.</p><p><b>Origin</b></p><p>Roldin was a young knight when the Long Night began. The sun simply never rose, and the land fell into chaos, as sinister creatures from under the earth arose to terrorize the surface. A mighty band of knights were summoned to restore order and daylight to the land. Roldin was counted among their number, as was his mentor, Kester the Brave. </p><p>Eventually, the band of knights found the source of the darkness, a decrepit mage's tower, swarming with living shadows. Somehow, the tower's resident had haphazardly opened a portal to the Plane of Shadow, which spiraled out of control, consumed the top floor of the tower, and caused an endless night.</p><p>The knights battled their way to the source of the disaster, slaying shadows as they went, but when they at last arrived, only Roldin and Kester still stood. As Kester tells it, both fought valiantly, but the void closed around Roldin, trapping him within. The other knights were revived, and given a hero's welcome upon returning home, but Roldin was never seen again. At least, that is, until a few weeks ago. </p><p>A knight in jet-black armor wielding Roldin's sword appeared out of thin air in the king's palace, slew Kester the Brave, and vanished just as quickly. Perhaps, the Black Knight only seeks revenge against the knights that once led him to the ill-fated tower, or perhaps he seeks to bring the Long Night again.</p><p><b>Battling Roldin</b></p><p>Roldin makes liberal use of his ability to become invisible at will, and prefers to strike unseen, and vanish quickly when his foe is slain. Only with a great deal of luck, and the ability to detect illusion magic, will the party ever catch him off-guard or interrupt one of his assassinations. </p><p>If he perceives the party to be a threat to his larger goals, or if the party successful impedes him, Roldin will strike them when they are at their most vulnerable: directly following a difficult fight with another foe, at the exact middle of a precarious rope bridge, or at night, when the campfire has just been extinguished. </p><p>Roldin is persistent, and does not sleep, eat, or drink. He will stalk his target for an extended time before striking, and is a devastating force when he appears.</p></div>","public":""},"alignment":"lawful

Around the same age, they begin showing an aptitude in magic, a few years after other elves.</p><p>Primitive Casting.</p><p>Once a blue elf's magical aptitude is revealed, they immediately begin training at the Magic Academy. However, though they go through the same rigorous training all initiates go through, the blue elves never show an aptitude with offensive spells, excelling instead at domination and manipulative spells.</p><p>Magnetic Aura.</p><p>Blue elves are trained separately from other initiates. This is not meant to segregate them for their skin color or primitive casting. Each blue elf is separated because the magic of others seem to be attracted to him. A spell cast in his vicinity will be redirected towards the elf and spit back at the unintentional assailant. At first, a blue elf has no control over this, but through years of study and training, learns to control this mysterious and powerful ability.</p><p>Magical Lightning Rod.</p><p>The King and his military advisors saw the power of the blue elves and knew that their power can be used to protect the large army under the King's control. Blue elves are used as a magical deterrent, their control of domination and manipulation spells make them the most effective tools at killing enemy magic users.</p></div>","public":""},"alignment":"unaligned","race":"","type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"Human","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"","cr":5,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":1800},"source":"KINGARMY","class":{"level":0,"name":"sorcerer"},"notes1name":"","notes2name":"","notes3name":"","notes4name":"","gender":"","age":"","height":"","weight":"","eyes":"","skin":"","hair":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","elvish"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":5,"bonus":0,"passive":15},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":5,"bonus":0,"passive":15},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":5,"bonus":0,"passive":15},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":5,"bonus":0,"passive":15},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":4},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":3},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":3},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":3},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":2},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"token":{"flags":{"token-auras":{"aura1":{"colour":"#ffffff","opacity":0.5,"distance":null,"square":false},"aura2":{"colour":"#ffffff","opacity":0.5,"distance":null,"square":false}},"token-hud-wildcard":{"default":""},"conditional-visibility":{"blindsight":false,"truesight":false,"devilssight":false,"tremorsense":false,"seeinvisible":false},"perfect-vision":{"visionRules":"default","monoVisionColor":"","_version":1,"sightLimit":null}},"name":"Vrikol Landcaster","displayName":20,"img":"moulinette/images/img/npccampaign01/Vrikol_Landcaster.Token.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightColor":null,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"XlEdTVhlvASwq3T5","actorLink":true,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false,"alpha":1},"items":[{"_id":"SvLUskc0WGyUsD2p","name":"Blade Ward","type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>You extend your hand and trace a sigil of warding in the air.

On a failed save, the spell continues as intended, but deals only half damage.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"requirements":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"flat"},"activation":{"type":"reaction","cost":1,"condition":""},"target":{"value":null,"units":"","type":""},"uses":{"value":5,"max":5,"per":"day"},"ability":"","actionType":"other","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"formula":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"consume":{"type":null,"target":null,"amount":null}},"img":"modules/plutonium/media/icon/mighty-force.svg","flags":{}}},"itemType":"Item","isLocked":false}}},"img":"modules/plutonium/media/icon/mighty-force.svg","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"nCngyUuKT6EBKFnI","name":"Spellcasting","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"162\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spellcasting.</span></span> <p>Spellcasting Ability=CHA</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Global Magic Attack Modifier=8</p><p>Magic Caster Level=10</p><p>Spell Save DC Mod=16</p><p>The blue elf is a 10th level spellcaster.
