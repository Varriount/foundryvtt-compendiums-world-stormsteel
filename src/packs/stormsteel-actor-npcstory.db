He is far more intimidating if placed against parties with a much lower level than his challenge, which is important to consider, because Roldin always fights alone. </p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>There's a great deal of mystery in Roldin's backstory, which the players will have to learn to before defeating him once and for all. How did Roldin really get trapped in the Plane of Shadow, how did he survive, and how did he return? Is Roldin acting alone, or at the behest of a more powerful entity? The only people that know the answers to these questions were the knights of Roldin's past, now old men, and being picked off one at a time by the vengeful knight.</p><p>Roldin can also be adapted to campaigns which focus on other planes, rather than the Plane of Shadow. A portal to the Abyss, the Hells, or the Far Realm can provide a suitable alternate origin for Roldin as well.</p><p><b>Origin</b></p><p>Roldin was a young knight when the Long Night began. The sun simply never rose, and the land fell into chaos, as sinister creatures from under the earth arose to terrorize the surface. A mighty band of knights were summoned to restore order and daylight to the land. Roldin was counted among their number, as was his mentor, Kester the Brave. </p><p>Eventually, the band of knights found the source of the darkness, a decrepit mage's tower, swarming with living shadows. Somehow, the tower's resident had haphazardly opened a portal to the Plane of Shadow, which spiraled out of control, consumed the top floor of the tower, and caused an endless night.</p><p>The knights battled their way to the source of the disaster, slaying shadows as they went, but when they at last arrived, only Roldin and Kester still stood. As Kester tells it, both fought valiantly, but the void closed around Roldin, trapping him within. The other knights were revived, and given a hero's welcome upon returning home, but Roldin was never seen again. At least, that is, until a few weeks ago. </p><p>A knight in jet-black armor wielding Roldin's sword appeared out of thin air in the king's palace, slew Kester the Brave, and vanished just as quickly. Perhaps, the Black Knight only seeks revenge against the knights that once led him to the ill-fated tower, or perhaps he seeks to bring the Long Night again.</p><p><b>Battling Roldin</b></p><p>Roldin makes liberal use of his ability to become invisible at will, and prefers to strike unseen, and vanish quickly when his foe is slain. Only with a great deal of luck, and the ability to detect illusion magic, will the party ever catch him off-guard or interrupt one of his assassinations. </p><p>If he perceives the party to be a threat to his larger goals, or if the party successful impedes him, Roldin will strike them when they are at their most vulnerable: directly following a difficult fight with another foe, at the exact middle of a precarious rope bridge, or at night, when the campfire has just been extinguished. </p><p>Roldin is persistent, and does not sleep, eat, or drink. He will stalk his target for an extended time before striking, and is a devastating force when he appears.</p></div>","public":""},"alignment":"lawful

Around the same age, they begin showing an aptitude in magic, a few years after other elves.</p><p>Primitive Casting.</p><p>Once a blue elf's magical aptitude is revealed, they immediately begin training at the Magic Academy. However, though they go through the same rigorous training all initiates go through, the blue elves never show an aptitude with offensive spells, excelling instead at domination and manipulative spells.</p><p>Magnetic Aura.</p><p>Blue elves are trained separately from other initiates. This is not meant to segregate them for their skin color or primitive casting. Each blue elf is separated because the magic of others seem to be attracted to him. A spell cast in his vicinity will be redirected towards the elf and spit back at the unintentional assailant.

Resembling nothing more than a scaly worm at first look, snakes are actually highly developed predators who slither across the ground in order to stealthily hunt their prey of smaller reptiles, rodents, and birds. Though there are many species of snake, we will only discuss the poisonous varieties within this article. Poisonous snakes bear a marked identifier separating them from their nonpoisonous brethren: the shape of their pupils. While snakes lacking venom glands have rounded pupils, those snakes with a venomous bite have slitted pupils much like those of a common domestic cat. The devious snake, however, has so much more beneath its scaly surface.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-size:13px\"><strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">Don't Tread on Me.</strong> Ever camouflaged both by their similarities to roots, sticks, or branches as well as the marvelous patterns of black, browns, greens, and tans speckling their hides, snakes are masters of blending into their surroundings. Even perched on a rock to warm their bodies in the heat of the sun, snakes can certainly be missed by just a passing glance. While the creature's eyesight is relatively poor, snakes have adapted an amazing ability to sense the world around them. Snakes \"smell\" with their tongues! Yes, by flicking their tongues out of their mouths with a fascinating flourish, these reptiles are able to smell prey or predators in their environment by collecting the miniscule scents on their tongues. Within the snake's mouth lies its most deadly asset in the form of two, hollow fangs. Snakes prefer to strike from the shadows, allowing their quiet method of travel to get them close enough to their prey to avoid a fight. The creature then lashes out in the blink of an eye, catching the unwary prey in their jaws while injecting them with a controlled dose of highly toxic venom through their hollow fangs. Then it's only a matter of moments until the poor creature is left dead by the snake's potent toxins. While the majority of snake species are not deadly to humanoids, caution is advised for those not well versed in identifying reptiles. Antidote should always be carried in areas known to house populations of poisonous snakes, just in case.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;font-size:13px;color:#111111\">\n<li

Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves' guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers.</p><p>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law.

During this time, you are <a href=\"https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#deafened_phb\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'conditionsdiseases.html', 'PHB', 'deafened_phb', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >deaf</a> and <a href=\"https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#blinded_phb\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'conditionsdiseases.html', 'PHB', 'blinded_phb', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >blind</a> with regard to your own senses.</p><p>As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.</p><p>You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.</p><p>Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.</p></div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","activation":{"type":"hour","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"inst"},"target":{"value":0,"width":null,"units":"any","type":"space"},"range":{"value":10,"long":0,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"0","per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"util","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"level":1,"school":"con","components":{"value":"","vocal":true,"somatic":true,"material":true,"ritual":true,"concentration":false},"materials":{"value":"10 gp worth of charcoal, incense, and herbs that must be consumed by fire in a brass brazier","consumed":true,"cost":10,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":true},"scaling":{"mode":"none","formula":""}},"sort":11001,"flags":{"midi-qol":{"onUseMacroName":""}},"img":"/systems/dnd5e/icons/spells/wild-eerie-2.jpg","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"cDMvhHPl4QhwwotG","name":"Hidden Blade","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<div>\n\t\t\t<div><i>Simple weapon (<a href=\"items.html#dagger_phb\"  onmouseover=\"Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'items.html', 'PHB', 'dagger_phb', null)\" onmouseleave=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)\" onmousemove=\"Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseMove(event, this)\"  ontouchstart=\"Renderer.hover.handleTouchStart(event, this)\" >dagger</a>), melee weapon, uncommon</i></div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"flex w-100\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-4\">100 gp, 1 lb.</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-8 text-right\">[[/r 1d4]] piercing  - finesse, light, special, thrown (20/60 ft.)</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<hr>\n\t\t<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><p>A fine weapon made for Assassins to execute their operations of exclusion, this weapon is attached to the arm of the person which keeps it hidden from plain sight.

He laughs as he charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his people's elk herd.</p><p>A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.</p><p>Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.</p><p>These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.</p><p>For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2148\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Primal Instinct</span></span> <p>People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature—keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt.</p><p>Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2149\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A Life of Danger</span></span> <p>Not every member of the tribes deemed \"barbarians\" by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don't have to.</p><p>Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2150\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Barbarian</span></span> <p>When creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant land, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where barbarians are common?</p><p>What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to \"civilized\" lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"2151\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a barbarian quickly by following these suggestions.

They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells and inventions. You can find everything you need to play one of these inventors in the next few sections. Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm.

As an artificer, you don't study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you'll use to produce your effects.

Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves' guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers.</p><p>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Rogue</span></span> <p>As you create your rogue character, consider the character's relationship to the law.

Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal?</p><p>What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend—another member of your adventuring party—who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"4\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions.

class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><p>Humming as she traces her fingers over an ancient monument in a long-forgotten ruin, a half-elf in rugged leathers finds knowledge springing into her mind, conjured forth by the magic of her song—knowledge of the people who constructed the monument and the mythic saga it depicts.</p><p>A stern human warrior bangs his sword rhythmically against his scale mail, setting the tempo for his war chant and exhorting his companions to bravery and heroism. The magic of his song fortifies and emboldens them.</p><p>Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnome weaves her subtle magic over the assembled nobles, ensuring that her companions' words will be well received.</p><p>Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"5\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Music and Magic</span></span> <p>In the worlds of D&amp;D, words and music are not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.</p><p>The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"6\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Learning from Experience</span></span> <p>True bards are not common in the world. Not every minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard's life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.</p><p>Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon—makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"7\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Bard</span></span> <p>Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true or not. Your character's background and motivations are not as important as the stories that he or she tells about them. Perhaps you had a secure and mundane childhood. There's no good story to be told about that, so you might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag in a dismal swamp. Or your childhood might be worthy of a story. Some bards acquire their magical music through extraordinary means, including the inspiration of fey or other supernatural creatures.</p><p>Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a master, following the more experienced bard until you were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you attend a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway or orphan, befriended by a wandering bard who became your mentor. Or you might have been a spoiled noble child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"8\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span></span> <p>You can make a bard quickly by following these suggestions.

Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.</p><p>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks.

Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves' guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers.</p><p>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.</p></div><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"107\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Rogue</span></span> <p>As you create your rogue character, consider the character's relationship to the law.

Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support.

He is far more intimidating if placed against parties with a much lower level than his challenge, which is important to consider, because Roldin always fights alone. </p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>There's a great deal of mystery in Roldin's backstory, which the players will have to learn to before defeating him once and for all. How did Roldin really get trapped in the Plane of Shadow, how did he survive, and how did he return? Is Roldin acting alone, or at the behest of a more powerful entity? The only people that know the answers to these questions were the knights of Roldin's past, now old men, and being picked off one at a time by the vengeful knight.</p><p>Roldin can also be adapted to campaigns which focus on other planes, rather than the Plane of Shadow. A portal to the Abyss, the Hells, or the Far Realm can provide a suitable alternate origin for Roldin as well.</p><p><b>Origin</b></p><p>Roldin was a young knight when the Long Night began. The sun simply never rose, and the land fell into chaos, as sinister creatures from under the earth arose to terrorize the surface. A mighty band of knights were summoned to restore order and daylight to the land. Roldin was counted among their number, as was his mentor, Kester the Brave. </p><p>Eventually, the band of knights found the source of the darkness, a decrepit mage's tower, swarming with living shadows. Somehow, the tower's resident had haphazardly opened a portal to the Plane of Shadow, which spiraled out of control, consumed the top floor of the tower, and caused an endless night.</p><p>The knights battled their way to the source of the disaster, slaying shadows as they went, but when they at last arrived, only Roldin and Kester still stood. As Kester tells it, both fought valiantly, but the void closed around Roldin, trapping him within. The other knights were revived, and given a hero's welcome upon returning home, but Roldin was never seen again. At least, that is, until a few weeks ago. </p><p>A knight in jet-black armor wielding Roldin's sword appeared out of thin air in the king's palace, slew Kester the Brave, and vanished just as quickly. Perhaps, the Black Knight only seeks revenge against the knights that once led him to the ill-fated tower, or perhaps he seeks to bring the Long Night again.</p><p><b>Battling Roldin</b></p><p>Roldin makes liberal use of his ability to become invisible at will, and prefers to strike unseen, and vanish quickly when his foe is slain.

He is far more intimidating if placed against parties with a much lower level than his challenge, which is important to consider, because Roldin always fights alone. </p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>There's a great deal of mystery in Roldin's backstory, which the players will have to learn to before defeating him once and for all. How did Roldin really get trapped in the Plane of Shadow, how did he survive, and how did he return? Is Roldin acting alone, or at the behest of a more powerful entity? The only people that know the answers to these questions were the knights of Roldin's past, now old men, and being picked off one at a time by the vengeful knight.</p><p>Roldin can also be adapted to campaigns which focus on other planes, rather than the Plane of Shadow. A portal to the Abyss, the Hells, or the Far Realm can provide a suitable alternate origin for Roldin as well.</p><p><b>Origin</b></p><p>Roldin was a young knight when the Long Night began. The sun simply never rose, and the land fell into chaos, as sinister creatures from under the earth arose to terrorize the surface. A mighty band of knights were summoned to restore order and daylight to the land. Roldin was counted among their number, as was his mentor, Kester the Brave. </p><p>Eventually, the band of knights found the source of the darkness, a decrepit mage's tower, swarming with living shadows. Somehow, the tower's resident had haphazardly opened a portal to the Plane of Shadow, which spiraled out of control, consumed the top floor of the tower, and caused an endless night.</p><p>The knights battled their way to the source of the disaster, slaying shadows as they went, but when they at last arrived, only Roldin and Kester still stood. As Kester tells it, both fought valiantly, but the void closed around Roldin, trapping him within. The other knights were revived, and given a hero's welcome upon returning home, but Roldin was never seen again. At least, that is, until a few weeks ago. </p><p>A knight in jet-black armor wielding Roldin's sword appeared out of thin air in the king's palace, slew Kester the Brave, and vanished just as quickly. Perhaps, the Black Knight only seeks revenge against the knights that once led him to the ill-fated tower, or perhaps he seeks to bring the Long Night again.</p><p><b>Battling Roldin</b></p><p>Roldin makes liberal use of his ability to become invisible at will, and prefers to strike unseen, and vanish quickly when his foe is slain.

As these elves reach their teenage years, their skin develops a light blue sheen, a glow which distinguishes them from their peers and all others. Around the same age, they begin showing an aptitude in magic, a few years after other elves.</p><p>Primitive Casting.</p><p>Once a blue elf's magical aptitude is revealed, they immediately begin training at the Magic Academy. However, though they go through the same rigorous training all initiates go through, the blue elves never show an aptitude with offensive spells, excelling instead at domination and manipulative spells.</p><p>Magnetic Aura.</p><p>Blue elves are trained separately from other initiates. This is not meant to segregate them for their skin color or primitive casting. Each blue elf is separated because the magic of others seem to be attracted to him. A spell cast in his vicinity will be redirected towards the elf and spit back at the unintentional assailant. At first, a blue elf has no control over this, but through years of study and training, learns to control this mysterious and powerful ability.</p><p>Magical Lightning Rod.</p><p>The King and his military advisors saw the power of the blue elves and knew that their power can be used to protect the large army under the King's control. Blue elves are used as a magical deterrent, their control of domination and manipulation spells make them the most effective tools at killing enemy magic users.</p></div>","public":""},"alignment":"unaligned","race":"","type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"Human","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"","cr":5,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":1800},"source":"KINGARMY","class":{"level":0,"name":"sorcerer"},"notes1name":"","notes2name":"","notes3name":"","notes4name":"","gender":"","age":"","height":"","weight":"","eyes":"","skin":"","hair":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","elvish"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":5,"bonus":0,"passive":15},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":5,"bonus":0,"passive":15},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":5,"bonus":0,"passive":15},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":5,"bonus":0,"passive":15},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":4},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":3},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":3},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":3},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":2},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"token":{"flags":{"token-auras":{"aura1":{"colour":"#ffffff","opacity":0.5,"distance":null,"square":false},"aura2":{"colour":"#ffffff","opacity":0.5,"distance":null,"square":false}},"token-hud-wildcard":{"default":""},"conditional-visibility":{"blindsight":false,"truesight":false,"devilssight":false,"tremorsense":false,"seeinvisible":false},"perfect-vision":{"visionRules":"default","monoVisionColor":"","_version":1,"sightLimit":null}},"name":"Vrikol Landcaster","displayName":20,"img":"moulinette/images/img/npccampaign01/Vrikol_Landcaster.Token.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightColor":null,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"XlEdTVhlvASwq3T5","actorLink":true,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false,"alpha":1},"items":[{"_id":"SvLUskc0WGyUsD2p","name":"Blade Ward","type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>You extend your hand and trace a sigil of warding in the air.
